# Decoding and ROC analysis

The data used was collected from a monkey trained to release a lever when two random dot stimuli moved coherently, which occured at a random time. Each patch overlapped one of the neuron’s RFs and the coherent motion was always in the neuron’s preferred direction.

Using ROC, I performed neurometric analysis and computed a neurometric score. I determined how well each neuron informs an ideal observer that the motion stimulus has occurred on a trial-by-trial basis.

Using ROC analysis, I computed a Detect Probability. I determined if the activity of either neuron was correlated with the animal's detection of the motion stimulus.
