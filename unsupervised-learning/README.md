# Unsupervised learning
See `report.pdf` for details.

## Part I: K-means clustering
I first explore the behaviour of the k-means clustering agent when given a specifc k-value. Then, I use the silhouette measure to determine the ideal value of k.

## Part II: Spike-time dependent plasticity
In this section, I explore results pertaining to STDP obtained in Song et al. 2000 and Song et al. 2001 using simulations `MATLAB/STDP/Song2000_F4.m` and `MATLAB/STDP/Song2001_F1.m` 

## Part III: Hopfield Networks
In this final section, I explore properties of an associative memory network, the Hopfield Network. I experiment with noise levels to find local minima and ghost states, altering memories, analytically deriving the information storage limit of a Hopfield network and finally computing the Lupyanov function of the network as it converges.
