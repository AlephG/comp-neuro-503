# Spike train statistics and measures of neural encoding

This project was divided in several steps outlines below. See `lab-handout.pdf` and `livescript-report.mlx` for more details.

## Part I: Spike Train Statistics
1. Generate binary representations of spike trains
2. Compute interspike interval statistics
3. Compute the autocorrelation functions and power spectra

## Part II: Measures of Neural Encoding
1. Generate raster plots and Peri-Stimulus-Time-Histogram (PSTH)
2. Compute the cross-correlation function and transfer function
3. Compute the signal-to-noise ratio
