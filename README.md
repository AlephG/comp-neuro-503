# Computational Neuroscience projects
Projects in this repo were completed in the context of a graduate-level course in computational neuroscience at McGill University in the Winter 2021 semester.

## H&H Formalism (hodgkin-huxley)
In this project, I constructed a Matlab model of voltage- and time-dependent current. Using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, the model mimics the voltage-clamp response of an unknown current recorded from a neuron.

## Decoding and ROC analysis (decoding-roc)
In this project, I analyzed the responses of two MT neurons that were simultaneously recorded from a monkey performing a motion detection task. The goal of this project was to apply ROC analysis to decode neural responses. Specifically, I performed ROC neurometric analysis and ROC detect probability.  

## Neural encoding (neural-encoding)
In this project, I explore neural encoding by first computing various neural spike train statistics such as the autocorrelation functions and power spectra of binary representations of the spike train. I then compute measures of neural encoding. 

## Reverse correlation and visual receptive fields (visual-rf)
In this project, I recover the temporal filter and static non-linearity from 1D and 3D temporal inputs to a neuron and its ouputs.  

## Supervised learning (supervised-learning)
In this project, I explore supervised learning using a single-layer classifier. I also compute visual receptive field estimation using regression and then compare it with an estimate obtained using cross-correlation.
