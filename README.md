# Computational Neuroscience projects
Projects in this repo were completed in the context of a graduate-level course in computational neuroscience at McGill University in the Winter 2021 semester.

## H&H Formalism (hodgkin-huxley)
In this project, I constructed a Matlab model of voltage- and time-dependent current. Using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, the model mimics the voltage-clamp response of an unknown current.
